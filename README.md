Problem Staement:

Social media platforms like TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram are key channels for influencers, brands, and marketers to reach and engage with their audience. However, predicting engagement rates—such as likes, comments, and shares—remains a challenge due to the varying dynamics across different platforms and influencer types.

This project aims to predict social media engagement rates for influencers across three major platforms: TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram. By analyzing follower counts and platform-specific data, we built and tuned regression models to estimate engagement rates, providing valuable insights for influencers, marketers, and social media platforms.

Key Features
- Data Integration: Combined datasets from TikTok, YouTube, and Instagram to create a unified view of influencer metrics.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized and explored follower counts and engagement trends across platforms.
- Model Building and Tuning: Developed and fine-tuned regression models (Decision Trees, Random Forests) to predict engagement rates, with hyperparameter optimization using GridSearchCV.
- Synthetic Data Testing: Evaluated model performance using synthetic data to test various scenarios and ensure robust predictions.
- Model Evaluation: Used metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-squared (R²) to assess model accuracy.

Improvements to be considered:

1. Add More Features:

Incorporate additional features such as content type (e.g., video, image, text), posting frequency, hashtags used, and geographic location. These could provide more context to the engagement rate predictions.

2. Time Series Analysis:

If you can access historical data, consider incorporating time series analysis to predict how engagement rates change over time.

3. Bias Analysis:

Analyze and mitigate any potential biases in the model, especially those related to demographics or platform-specific trends.
